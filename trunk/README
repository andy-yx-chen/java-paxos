The entry point into the system is the Main class. Once running,
type "help" to get a list of commands.

We recommend startingoff with an init and clear command.

An example execution would be:
init 5
clear
propose a
propose b
propose c
start
propose d
propose e
propose f
stop
print
exit

The "help" command should provide additional help for each command implemented.

The "test" command should allow for testing the failure scenarios laid out in the prompt.
